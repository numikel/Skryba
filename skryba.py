            Input: 61% of people fail at negotiating a higher salary after receiving a job offer. And you want to guess why? It's not because of the economy, it's not because the employer is being unreasonable, and it's not because they have no other offers to leverage. Most of those people lost right then and there when they decided to not even try to negotiate for a higher salary.
            n this video, I'm going to first help you understand the three practical consequences of not negotiating. Because I have the best salary negotiation strategies in the world, but if you don't get over that mental barrier first, none of it matters. Then I'm going to share my five favorite tips when negotiating salary after receiving a job offer, so that you can put them into practice right away.
            i friends, welcome back to the channel. If you're new here, my name is Jeff and we’re all about practical career and interview tips. So if you're a current student or young professional, consider subscribing for more actionable content.
            he most common reason candidates are hesitant to negotiate salary is because they believe they have no bargaining power. A fresh graduate might think, “Well, this is my first job, I have no experience, I have no bargaining power.” Even experienced professionals might think, “Hey, if I have no other offers, I have no leverage.” But here’s what you have to understand: the hiring process is stressful and expensive for the employer as well. Employers screen hundreds, if not thousands of resumes, spend countless hours analyzing and choosing applicants before finally deciding on a few to hire. By this point, the employer is invested in those candidates. So even fresh graduates have some bargaining power.
            ow, let’s dive into three very real consequences if you choose not to negotiate your salary after receiving a job offer.
            irst, compounding means you lose out financially in a very big way. Imagine two people with a 10% difference in starting salary—$50,000 a year and $55,000 a year. Now, let’s assume that both receive a 6% salary increase every year for the next 30 years. By year 10, the difference in their cumulative pay will be around $75,000. By year 20, $200,000. And by year 30, a whopping $424,000. This simplified example doesn’t even take into account future career moves. If you move to another company, that nice 20% pay bump they’re offering is usually anchored to what you’re currently being paid. So this $424,000 gap can actually be much larger.
            econd, by choosing not to negotiate, you lose out on benefits the employer could have easily agreed to—like more vacation days, education reimbursement, or a later start date.
            hird, you lose an opportunity to make a strong first impression. Negotiation is a valuable life skill that benefits you both personally and professionally. Your employer knows this. By even attempting to negotiate, you may become more attractive in their eyes.
            ow that you're hopefully more comfortable with the idea of negotiating salary after receiving a job offer, let’s talk about five techniques you can use.
            ip 1: Imagine you’re negotiating for a close friend or a loved one. This shift in mindset helps you become more confident and assertive. Think about how hard they worked for this job, all the prep and sacrifices. Don’t they deserve to be paid their worth? That feeling you get—that’s called indignation, and it can help you overcome your fear of negotiation.
            ip 2: Give a specific salary figure. Don’t ask for a round number. Saying $57,650 instead of $57,000 makes you more likely to end up closer to your target. According to research from Columbia Business School, employers are more likely to assume you’ve done your homework if you present a specific figure. It makes sense—if a friend told you their exact salary and they have a similar background, you’d feel more confident asking for the same.
            ip 3: Have a walk-away point. You should research and determine a target salary, using tools like salary comparison sites. Pick a number in the 80-85th percentile of the range. The point of a walk-away number is to mentally prepare yourself to say “no” if the offer is too low to make sense for you financially.
            ip 4: Use facts, not feelings. Employers are more likely to consider your proposal if you back it up with data. For example, say you’re asking for a 15% increase because you have two more years of experience than the average person on the team. Use neutral language and explain your reasoning. Here’s a sample response: “The industry average is $62,500, and Unilever pays around $64,000. Your offer is slightly below both. With my four years of experience in consumer goods and based on what the hiring manager shared with me, I feel I’m well-positioned to help with the challenges the team is facing. Is there any way we can get closer to the industry benchmark?”
            ip 5: Negotiate ethically. Only negotiate with employers whose offer you would accept if the negotiation goes well. It’s unethical to negotiate an offer you don’t intend to accept, even if your conditions are met. If you do accept an offer, stop interviewing elsewhere and inform other companies that you’re withdrawing from the process. Don’t burn bridges—you never know when you’ll cross paths again.
            onus tip: Always express gratitude for the offer throughout the negotiation process. It helps you appear more likable and signals good intentions.

            Output (summary):
            According to research, 61% of people fail to negotiate a higher salary after receiving a job offer. This is not due to the economy, unreasonable employers, or lack of alternative offers. The real reason is psychological—many candidates simply don’t try. Overcoming this mental barrier is critical, as not negotiating can have long-term financial and professional consequences.
            The video outlines three practical consequences of skipping salary negotiations. First, the financial impact of not negotiating is substantial. A 10% difference in starting salary, when compounded over 30 years with standard raises, can lead to a lifetime earnings gap of over $400,000. Second, by not negotiating, candidates miss out on non-monetary benefits like additional vacation days, flexible start dates, or education reimbursements—benefits employers might have easily agreed to. Third, avoiding negotiation means missing a chance to make a strong first impression. Employers value negotiation skills, and simply trying can position you as a more capable and confident professional.
            To help overcome the fear of negotiation and improve results, the speaker shares five proven techniques:
            1. Negotiate as if for a friend: Shifting your mindset and imagining you’re advocating for someone else (like a close friend or loved one) can make you more assertive and confident. Recognizing the hard work your “friend” put into getting the offer can stir feelings of indignation, which can help you push past hesitation and speak up.
            2. Give a specific salary number: Instead of quoting round numbers, use precise figures (e.g., $57,650 rather than $57,000). Research from Columbia Business School suggests that specific numbers imply deeper research and preparation, making employers more likely to take the offer seriously and meet you closer to your target.
            3. Have a walk-away point: Know your minimum acceptable salary before you enter negotiations. Do your homework using salary comparison tools and aim for the 80th–85th percentile of the market range. Mentally preparing to walk away helps protect you from accepting an offer that could lead to long-term regret.
            4. Use facts, not feelings: Employers respond better when you back up your request with data. For example, citing industry averages and pointing to your relevant experience or contributions shows that your request is grounded and reasonable. Use neutral, respectful language to avoid sounding arrogant or demanding.
            5. Negotiate ethically: Only enter negotiations with employers whose offer you’re seriously considering. It’s unethical to negotiate in bad faith—if you're not planning to accept even the best possible terms. Once you accept an offer, you should stop interviewing elsewhere and inform other companies to avoid burning bridges.
            As a final piece of advice, express gratitude throughout the negotiation process. Being polite and appreciative helps you appear professional and likeable, which can influence how your request is received.
            Negotiating salary is not only about money—it’s a key moment to demonstrate professionalism, preparation, and confidence. Understanding the consequences of not negotiating and using effective strategies can help candidates secure better compensation and begin their careers on the right foot.
